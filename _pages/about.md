I'm a first-year Master student from [Department of Mathematics](https://lsa.umich.edu/math) at [University of Michigan, Ann arbor](https://umich.edu).

Before that, I recevied my Bachlor Degree in Mathematics from [Beijing Normal University](https://english.bnu.edu.cn).

Aside from those, I'm a figure skating fan(rooting for Yelim Kim and Jia Shin).

I'm also a junior Anki user.

I'll share some of my thoughts in the blog posts section. It may be a bit boring.
